# Fantasy-Premier-League :soccer:

Welcome to my FPL project! The aim is go end to end from data collection to predicting the players to have the most points this season.
This readme will be updated as I progress along

## Objectives :memo: 
- Collect historical FPL player data, as far as data is available
- Populate into a clean dataframe, fit for purpose for predictive modelling
- Train and test model
- Output results

I am open to ideas/improvements
